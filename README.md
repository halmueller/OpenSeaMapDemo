# OpenSeaMapDemo

This iOS project uses MKTileOverlay to display the [OpenSeaMap](http://www.openseamap.org/index.php?id=openseamap&L=1) tiles on top of a standard MKMapView.

This is a universal app, written mostly in Swift, and borrowing from [FormatterKit](https://github.com/mattt/FormatterKit). OpenSeaMap tiles are rendered using MKTileOverlay and MKTileOverlayRenderer.
